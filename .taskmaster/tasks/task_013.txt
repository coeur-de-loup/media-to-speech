# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Worker Crash Recovery and Job Resumption (uv/FastAPI Environment)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure that if a worker crashes mid-job, it can resume processing from Redis state, using the FastAPI/uv stack.
# Details:
- On startup, scan Redis for jobs in PROCESSING state.
- Resume chunk processing for incomplete jobs.
- Ensure idempotency for already-processed chunks.
- Publish recovery events to Redis stream.
- Ensure all worker dependencies are managed via uv and compatible with FastAPI.

# Test Strategy:
- Unit test: recovery logic, idempotency.
- Chaos test: kill worker mid-job and verify resumption.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Redis Scanning on Startup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop logic to scan Redis for existing jobs or relevant data when the application starts, ensuring awareness of in-progress or incomplete jobs.
### Details:
This involves connecting to Redis, querying for job keys or relevant data structures, and loading their state into memory or a processing queue.

## 2. Develop Job Resumption Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create mechanisms to resume jobs that were in progress or incomplete at the time of the last shutdown or crash.
### Details:
Utilize the data loaded from Redis to identify jobs needing resumption, and safely restart their processing from the correct state.

## 3. Add Idempotency Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Ensure that job processing is idempotent, so that reprocessing the same job does not cause unintended side effects or duplicate work.
### Details:
Implement checks using Redis or other mechanisms to track job completion and prevent duplicate processing.

## 4. Publish Recovery Events [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Implement event publishing to notify external systems or logs when a recovery or job resumption occurs.
### Details:
Integrate with an event bus or logging system to emit structured events whenever a job is resumed after a crash or restart.

## 5. Perform Chaos Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Design and execute chaos tests to simulate crashes and verify the robustness of recovery, idempotency, and event publishing logic.
### Details:
Automate tests that forcibly crash the system and validate that jobs are resumed correctly, no duplicates occur, and recovery events are published.

## 6. Document Crash Recovery and Idempotency Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.5
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation describing the crash recovery, job resumption, idempotency, and event publishing processes.
### Details:
Include architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and instructions for operating and troubleshooting the system.
