# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create Docker Compose File for Multi-Container Setup (uv/FastAPI Environment)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the ffmpegofficial container, the FastAPI/uv-based API service, and the Reddit container, ensuring proper networking and configuration for local development and testing.
# Details:
1. Define services in docker-compose.yml: (a) ffmpegofficial: Use the official FFmpeg image, configure volumes if needed for media processing, and expose necessary ports. (b) api: Build from the local Dockerfile or use a prebuilt image, set environment variables (e.g., Redis connection, OpenAI keys), and link to ffmpegofficial and Reddit containers. The API service should use FastAPI as the framework and uv as the Python dependency manager. (c) reddit: Use the appropriate Reddit container image, configure authentication/secrets, and expose required ports. 2. Set up a shared network for inter-container communication. 3. Configure volumes for persistent data (e.g., /tmp, logs). 4. Add healthcheck sections for each service, leveraging the /healthz endpoint for the FastAPI API (from Task 12). 5. Ensure service dependencies (e.g., API waits for ffmpeg and Reddit to be healthy). 6. Document usage: starting, stopping, and troubleshooting the stack, including FastAPI/uv-specific notes. 7. Optionally, add support for .env files for configuration flexibility.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run 'docker-compose up' and verify all three containers start successfully and can communicate. 2. Confirm the API container can invoke ffmpeg commands via the ffmpegofficial service. 3. Validate the Reddit container is accessible and functional. 4. Use 'docker-compose ps' and logs to check health status and readiness. 5. Test the /healthz endpoint of the FastAPI API via curl from the host and from within other containers. 6. Stop and restart individual containers to ensure proper recovery and networking. 7. Review documentation for clarity and completeness, including FastAPI/uv usage.
