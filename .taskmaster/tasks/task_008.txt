# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Job Cleanup and Resource Deletion (uv/FastAPI Environment)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Delete all temporary files and chunks in /tmp/{job-id}/ after job completion or failure, ensuring compatibility with the FastAPI/uv stack.
# Details:
- On job COMPLETED or FAILED, recursively delete /tmp/{job-id}/ directory.
- Ensure cleanup runs even if worker crashes (on restart, check for stale jobs).
- Remove Redis keys after TTL expires (7 days).

# Test Strategy:
- Unit test: cleanup logic, directory deletion.
- Integration test: verify /tmp/{job-id}/ is empty after job ends.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Cleanup Trigger Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the logic that determines when the cleanup process should be initiated based on system events or schedules.
### Details:
This includes setting up event listeners, timers, or hooks that will trigger the cleanup process under appropriate conditions.

## 2. Develop Recursive File Deletion [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a function to recursively delete files and directories as part of the cleanup process.
### Details:
Ensure the function safely traverses directories and removes all nested files and folders, handling errors gracefully.

## 3. Integrate Crash Recovery Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Add logic to check for incomplete cleanups or crashes and resume or rollback as needed.
### Details:
Implement mechanisms to detect interrupted cleanup operations and ensure system consistency upon restart.

## 4. Manage Redis TTL for Cleanup Metadata [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Set and manage Time-To-Live (TTL) values in Redis for metadata related to cleanup operations.
### Details:
Ensure that metadata stored in Redis expires appropriately to prevent stale data and support efficient resource management.
