# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement GET /jobs/{id} Endpoint (Polling and Streaming) with FastAPI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Expose FastAPI endpoint to poll job status or stream updates via SSE/WebSocket, mirroring Redis messages.
# Details:
- Support GET /jobs/{id} for polling (returns current state/progress) using FastAPI route.
- Support GET /jobs/{id}?stream=true for SSE (text/event-stream) or WebSocket upgrade.
- Stream JSON patches reflecting Redis pub/sub updates.
- Handle client disconnects and reconnections gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
- Unit test: endpoint logic, SSE/WS upgrade.
- Integration test: poll and stream job status, verify real-time updates.
- Integration test: confirm FastAPI endpoint is accessible without authentication.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Polling Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a RESTful polling endpoint to allow clients to periodically request updates from the server.
### Details:
Design and implement an HTTP endpoint that clients can poll for updates. Ensure it supports efficient data retrieval and handles client state.

## 2. Add Server-Sent Events (SSE) Support [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Integrate SSE to enable real-time one-way communication from server to client.
### Details:
Implement an SSE endpoint that streams updates to clients as events occur. Ensure proper event formatting and connection management.

## 3. Integrate WebSocket Support [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Enable full-duplex communication between server and client using WebSockets.
### Details:
Set up a WebSocket server endpoint, handle connection upgrades, and manage message broadcasting to connected clients.

## 4. Implement JSON Patch Streaming [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Stream JSON Patch updates to clients for efficient state synchronization.
### Details:
Generate and transmit JSON Patch (RFC 6902) operations over SSE and WebSocket connections to minimize data transfer.

## 5. Handle Disconnect and Reconnect Scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Ensure robust handling of client disconnects and reconnections across all communication protocols.
### Details:
Implement logic to detect disconnects, resume sessions, and synchronize missed updates upon client reconnection.

## 6. Develop Comprehensive Testing Suite [done]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Create tests to verify functionality, protocol compliance, and edge cases for all communication methods.
### Details:
Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests covering polling, SSE, WebSocket, JSON Patch streaming, and reconnect logic.
