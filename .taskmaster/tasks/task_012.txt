# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Health, Readiness, and Metrics Endpoints with FastAPI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Expose /healthz, /readyz, and /metrics endpoints using FastAPI for orchestration and observability.
# Details:
- /healthz: returns 200 if service is up (FastAPI route).
- /readyz: checks Redis and OpenAI API connectivity.
- /metrics: Prometheus format (job count, chunk latency, error counts).
- Integrate with Docker HEALTHCHECK.
- Ensure all endpoints are implemented as FastAPI routes and dependencies managed via uv.

# Test Strategy:
- Unit test: endpoint responses.
- Integration test: simulate dependency failures and verify readiness/metrics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement /healthz Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the /healthz endpoint to report basic application health status.
### Details:
Develop an HTTP endpoint (/healthz) that returns a simple success response if the application is running.

## 2. Implement /readyz Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop the /readyz endpoint to verify readiness, including checks for dependencies.
### Details:
Create an HTTP endpoint (/readyz) that performs checks on external dependencies (e.g., database, cache) and returns readiness status.

## 3. Implement /metrics Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Expose application metrics via a /metrics endpoint for observability.
### Details:
Add a /metrics endpoint that provides Prometheus-compatible metrics about the application's performance and resource usage.

## 4. Integrate Docker HEALTHCHECK [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Configure Dockerfile to use HEALTHCHECK with the /healthz endpoint.
### Details:
Update the Dockerfile to include a HEALTHCHECK instruction that periodically queries the /healthz endpoint to determine container health.

## 5. Develop and Execute Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Create and run tests to validate /healthz, /readyz, /metrics endpoints, and Docker HEALTHCHECK integration.
### Details:
Write automated and manual test cases to ensure all endpoints function correctly and Docker HEALTHCHECK operates as expected.
