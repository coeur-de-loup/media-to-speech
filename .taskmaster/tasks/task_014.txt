# Task ID: 14
# Title: Write Unit, Integration, Load, and Chaos Tests (uv/FastAPI Environment)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 10, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive tests for all components as per the test plan, ensuring tests are compatible with FastAPI and uv.
# Details:
- Unit: FFmpeg wrapper, timestamp adjuster, Redis adapter, FastAPI endpoints.
- Integration: end-to-end jobs with various media lengths and formats.
- Load: simulate 100 concurrent jobs, monitor scaling and memory.
- Chaos: kill worker mid-job, verify job resumes.
- Use CI pipeline for automated test execution.
- Ensure test environment uses uv for dependency management and FastAPI for API testing.

# Test Strategy:
- Automated test suite with coverage reports.
- Manual verification for chaos/load scenarios.
- Integration test: confirm all FastAPI endpoints are accessible without authentication.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Unit Test Development [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop unit tests for individual components and functions to ensure correctness at the smallest level.
### Details:
Identify core modules and write unit tests using the chosen testing framework. Ensure high coverage of critical logic.

## 2. Integration Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Design and implement integration tests to verify interactions between multiple components.
### Details:
Define key integration points and create test cases that simulate real-world interactions between modules.

## 3. Load Test Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Set up load testing to evaluate system performance under expected and peak loads.
### Details:
Select load testing tools, define load profiles, and configure scripts to simulate concurrent users and requests.

## 4. Chaos Test Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Implement chaos testing to assess system resilience under unexpected failures.
### Details:
Identify critical failure points, use chaos engineering tools to inject faults, and monitor system behavior.

## 5. CI Pipeline Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Integrate all test suites into the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for automated execution.
### Details:
Update CI configuration to run unit, integration, load, and chaos tests on code changes and deployments.

## 6. Coverage Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.5
### Description: Generate and analyze code coverage reports from automated test runs.
### Details:
Configure coverage tools in the CI pipeline, collect metrics, and identify untested code areas.

## 7. Manual Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.6
### Description: Perform manual testing to validate edge cases and user experience not covered by automated tests.
### Details:
Create manual test cases, execute them on the application, and document findings for further improvements.

## 8. Test Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.7
### Description: Document all test strategies, cases, and results for future reference and onboarding.
### Details:
Compile documentation covering test approaches, tools used, coverage reports, and manual test outcomes.
