# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Redis State Management and Pub/Sub for Job Progress (uv/FastAPI Environment)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Persist job state, progress, and errors in Redis keys and publish updates to Redis stream for real-time subscription, using the FastAPI/uv stack.
# Details:
- Use Redis HASH/STRING for meta, state, progress, error.
- Use Redis STREAM for transcribe:jobs:{id} for push updates.
- Publish state transitions and progress after each major step (QUEUED, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED).
- Ensure atomic updates and recovery logic for crash resilience.
- Ensure Redis client is managed via uv and compatible with FastAPI.

# Test Strategy:
- Unit test: Redis adapter, pub/sub logic.
- Integration test: subscribe to stream and verify real-time updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Redis Schema Design [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the Redis data structures to efficiently store and retrieve application data, considering keys, data types, and relationships.
### Details:
Define the schema for entities, indexes, and relationships using Redis data types such as hashes, sets, sorted sets, and streams.

## 2. State, Progress, and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement mechanisms to track task state, progress, and error information within Redis.
### Details:
Define fields and structures to represent task states (e.g., pending, running, completed, failed), progress metrics, and error logs.

## 3. Stream Publishing [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Set up Redis Streams to publish real-time updates about task state changes and events.
### Details:
Configure stream keys, message formats, and consumer groups for real-time notification and event-driven processing.

## 4. Atomic Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Ensure all state changes and data modifications are performed atomically to prevent race conditions and maintain consistency.
### Details:
Utilize Redis transactions, Lua scripts, or other atomic operations to update multiple keys or fields safely.

## 5. Crash Recovery [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Design and implement strategies to recover from crashes and ensure data integrity and consistency after failures.
### Details:
Develop mechanisms to detect incomplete operations, replay or rollback transactions, and restore correct state after a crash.

## 6. Test Coverage [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Develop comprehensive tests to validate schema correctness, atomicity, stream publishing, error handling, and crash recovery.
### Details:
Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure all components work as expected and edge cases are handled.
