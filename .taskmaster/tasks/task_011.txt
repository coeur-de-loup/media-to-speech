# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement DELETE /jobs/{id} Endpoint (Job Cancellation) with FastAPI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Allow clients to cancel a running job via FastAPI, marking it as FAILED and cleaning up resources.
# Details:
- On DELETE, set job state to FAILED in Redis and publish update.
- Attempt to stop any in-progress chunk processing.
- Trigger cleanup of /tmp/{job-id}/.
- Return 202 Accepted on success.

# Test Strategy:
- Unit test: cancellation logic, Redis state update.
- Integration test: cancel running job and verify cleanup and state.
- Integration test: confirm FastAPI endpoint is accessible without authentication.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Endpoint Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the API endpoint that initiates the processing workflow, handling incoming requests and validating input.
### Details:
Define the endpoint route, parse request data, and ensure proper validation and error handling before proceeding to state management.

## 2. Integrate Redis State Update [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Add logic to update and manage processing state in Redis, reflecting the current status of each request.
### Details:
Ensure the endpoint updates Redis with relevant state changes (e.g., started, in-progress, completed, failed) and handles potential race conditions.

## 3. Handle In-Progress Processing Interruption [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Implement mechanisms to detect and interrupt in-progress processing tasks as needed, ensuring consistency and reliability.
### Details:
Design logic to check for interruption signals, gracefully stop processing, and update Redis state accordingly.

## 4. Trigger Cleanup Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Develop and integrate cleanup routines that are triggered after processing interruption or completion to release resources and maintain system hygiene.
### Details:
Ensure cleanup logic is robust, idempotent, and can handle partial failures or retries.

## 5. Implement Response Handling and Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Finalize response logic for the endpoint and create comprehensive tests to validate all workflow scenarios, including edge cases.
### Details:
Return appropriate responses based on processing outcomes and write tests for endpoint logic, Redis updates, interruption, and cleanup.
